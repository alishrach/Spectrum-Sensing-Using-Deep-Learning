**Abstract**

Wireless communication networks face significant challenges due to spectrum congestion, signal interference, and low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). This dissertation addresses these issues through the application of deep learning techniques to spectrum sensing. The study introduces a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Networks (ResNets) to classify wireless signals effectively, even in noisy environments.

**Key features include:**

Utilization of the RADIOML 2018.01A dataset for diverse modulation schemes.
Application of feature extraction techniques (e.g., cumulants, spectral features, energy statistics) to enhance model performance.
Hyperparameter optimization and regularization for improved classification accuracy across varied SNR levels.
Highlights

**Model Architecture:** Combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and ResNets for deeper network training.

**Performance:** Achieved superior classification accuracy, particularly at low SNR levels, through feature engineering.

**Applications:** Results demonstrate scalability for cognitive radio networks and advanced communication systems.

**Key Outcomes**

Achieved an overall classification accuracy of 85.1% at SNR levels of 22 dB with feature extraction.

Enhanced performance in high-noise conditions, reaching accuracy of 27.3% at -4 dB, showcasing robustness.

Demonstrated significant gains in accuracy across modulation schemes such as QPSK (61.5%), 16QAM (56.2%), and BPSK (67.3%).

Validated the importance of feature extraction in boosting classification accuracy, particularly at low SNR levels.
